### Git

Imagine each time you make any changes to your project folder, you copied all the files to a new folder and gave it a date and time: 

```{text}
project/ 
└── 2020-12-28_v2/
    ├── scripts/
    │   ├── data-clean.R
    │   └── analysis-reg.R
    └── data/
        ├── main_data.csv
        └── data_to_merge.csv
└── 2020-12-28_v1/
    ├── scripts/
    │   ├── data-clean.R
    │   └── analysis-reg.R
    └── data/
        ├── main_data.csv
        └── data_to_merge.csv
└── 2020-12-27/
    ├── scripts/
    │   ├── data-clean.R
    │   └── analysis-reg.R
    └── data/
        └── main_data.csv
```

Things you wish you could do:

- Not use up all your storage in 3 days
- Compare files between versions easily
- Know what you changed in each version
- Be able to undo 'accidents' of all shapes and sizes

`git` will accomplish all four!

Each of these folders will be called a `commit`. 

Version control is just a long string of commits in a row that keep track of all the changes in a project `repository` (`repo` for short).


```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/commit_history_eg.png")
```

`git` workflow


```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/basic_git.png")
```


- **Working Directory**: 
   - Work as normal, any changes you hit save on end up in the working directory.
- **Stage**: 
   - Changes that you intend to capture in a `commit`, put in the staging area.
- **History**: 
   - When you `commit` you add the saved changes into the history. This history contains all the `commits`.

# Learning Git with Github Desktop

Let's create our first git using Github Desktop. All of the git functionality is available via the terminal but point and click is much more user friendly.

To get started need the three following things:

- [Download git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
- [Download Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/)
- [Create Github Acount](https://github.com/)


---
```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_create1.png")
```

---

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_create2.png")
```

---

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_create3.png")
```


---
Let's create a file called `example.R` in RStudio and save it to the repository with the following contents

```{r, eval=FALSE}
plot(mtcars$mpg)
```

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_commit1.png")
```


---
To commit changes, select the files you want to commit (or even just subset of lines you want to commit) and type a commit message

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_commit2.png")
```

---
### An aside about commit messages

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/commit_messages_cartoon.png")
```

from https://chris.beams.io/posts/git-commit/.

---

1. The `message` should be equivalent to the subject of the email.
  - Use a verb in the imperative form, e.g. Add, Remove, Fix, Replace, Update, etc.

2. Description area is for more details. You should include *why* you had to make these changes if you're fixing problems. Good messages to yourself can only help.

3. One task per commit. You should not have "Add X regression, Changed Y data, redid Z" all in one commit. 



---
You can view the chain of commits in the History tab


```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_history1.png")
```


---

You can commit particular lines (especially useful if you are working with a large file)

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_desktop_commit4.png")
```



---
## What is Github?

Git is all local to your computer. You can be completely offline and still use git.

Github is a website where you can store a cloud version of your repository (either privately or publicly) and where you can collaborate with multiple people.


Simply put: **Git = Word Document; Github = Google Docs**


---
### Example Repository: My templates repository

Let's open an example repository and I'll show you around github: 
https://github.com/kylebutts/templates/

```{r, echo=F, eval=T}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh1.png")
```


Checklist:
- Viewing commit log
- Viewing file-specific commit log
- Github issues




---
## Creating GitHub Repository from Local Repository

With repository open, click "Publish repository"

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_publish1.png")
```

---

Give the repo a name and click "Publish repository"

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_publish2.png")
```



---
## Creating Local copy of GitHub Repository (Cloning)

First go to the repository you want to clone: [This talk repository here](https://github.com/kylebutts/git_rmd_talk). Then click Open with Github Desktop.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_clone1.png")
```

---

Select the folder you want to save this repository in.

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.width='100%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/gh_clone2.png")
```

# R Markdown

R Markdown allows you to create documents with text, code, and the code's output easily. These slides are created with R Markdown. 

Within the repo, I have two example .Rmd files. Let's open these in R Studio and explore them.


---

```{r, echo=F, eval=T, out.width='80%', fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics("graphics/rmd_example.jpg")
```

### Three Components to an R Markdown File
1. YAML
  - Top of document. Contains the information for how to convert .Rmd file to other forms: e.g. html document, pdf document, html slides, beamer slides, tufte format, distill format, etc. 
  - Full list of output formats [here](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/formats.html)
  - Contains authors, title, date, etc. for title
2. Markdown
  - Text of document. Can use headers, lists, links, text styling, etc. 
  - [Cheatsheet](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf)
  - Can contain latex math equations.
3. Code Chunk
  - Run R code and produces results below. This can make tables, figures, and display console output. 
  - Options to show/hide code, show/hide output.
  - [Tutorial on R Chunks](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/lesson-3.html)
