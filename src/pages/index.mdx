<Hello />

My name is Kyle.

<p><strong>I am on the economics job market during the 2023-24 academic year.</strong></p> 

I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Colorado: Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/) focusing in the fields of _Urban Economics_ and _Applied Econometrics_. [My work](/papers/) has been published in Journal of Urban Economics, Journal of Urban Economics: Insights, and other journals. My CV can be accessed [here](/files/KyleButts-CV.pdf). I also proudly contribute to [open source](/open-source/) statistical software.

My work connects urban economics questions with econometric tools including: 

- [Treatment effect estimation when treated units are not on parallel-trends (my JMP)](/papers/generalized-imputation-estimators)
- [Local labor market multipliers using modern shift-share instrument](/papers/fiscal-consolidation)
- [Controlling for spillovers in treatment effect estimation without imposing a spatial model](/papers/Spatial-Spillovers)
- [Estimation of urban wage premiums accounting for spatial sorting](/papers/urban-wage-premium)
