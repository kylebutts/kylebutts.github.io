I am a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Colorado: Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/) focusing in the fields of Urban Economics and Applied Econometrics. Here is my [CV](/files/KyleButts-CV.pdf).

My work has been published in *Journal of Urban Economics*, *Journal of Urban Economics: Insights*, and other journals. My [job market paper](/papers/Generalized-Imputation-Estimator) is R&R at the *Journal of Econometrics*.

My work connects urban economics questions with econometric tools including: 

- [Treatment effect estimation when treated units are on different economic trends (my JMP)](/papers/generalized-imputation-estimators)
- [Estimation of historical urban wage premiums accounting for spatial sorting](/papers/urban-wage-premium)
- [Local labor market multipliers using modern shift-share instrument](/papers/fiscal-consolidation)
- [Controlling for spillovers in treatment effect estimation without imposing a spatial model](/papers/Spatial-Spillovers)
