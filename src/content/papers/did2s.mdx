## Abstract

Recent work has highlighted the difficulties of estimating difference-in-differences models when treatment timing occurs at different times for different units. This article introduces the R package `{did2s}` which implements the estimator introduced in [Gardner (2021)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05943). The article provides an approachable review of the underlying econometric theory and introduces the syntax for the function `did2s`. Further, the package introduces a function, `event_study`, that provides a common syntax for all the modern event-study estimators and plot_event_study to plot the results of each estimator. 


## 5-Minute Summary

The standard difference-in-differences estimator is modeled using the <Color kelly>Two-way Fixed Effects Model</Color>. Unit $i$ and time $t$ has potential outcome:

$$
y_{it} = \mu_i + \eta_t + \tau D_{it} + \varepsilon_{it},
$$

where $D_{it}$ is an idicator variable that equals one when unit $i$ is currently experiencing treatment at time $t$. Researchers aim to estimate the effects of treatment and summarize it as the **Average Treatment Effect on the Treatment**, $\tau$.

*If the two-way fixed effects model is correctly specified and the parallel trends assumption is satisfied, then OLS is fine and even BLUE! (woohoo ðŸŽ‰ðŸŽ‰)* So what's with all these new Diff-in-Diff doesn't work well problems? 

### Problem 1: $\tau$ is not constant

The first problem is that $\tau$ is not typically constant across units and over time:

- Treatment effects may depend on when you start treatment. For example, groups that benefit more from a policy implement it earlier

- Treatment effects may depend on treatment duration like an event-study. For example, policy effects slowly take hold as the policy is adopted broadly.

Our TWFE model clearly needs to be enriched: 
$$
y_{it} = \mu_i + \eta_t + \tau_{gt} D_{it} + \varepsilon_{it},
$$
where now we have what the literature calls the **Group-Time Average Treatment Effect**, $\tau_{gt}$. This captures the two forms of treatment effect heterogeneity described above. The treatment effect size to depend on when you are treated, group $g$, and how many periods it has been since treatment determined by $t âˆ’ g$. It will prove really hard to accurately estimate any particular $\tau_{gt}$, so researchers will try to estimate the **Overall Average Treatment Effect**:
$$
\tau \equiv \frac{1}{N_{gt}}\sum \tau_{gt},
$$
the average of $\tau_{gt}$ across all $(g,t)$ observed in the sample.

### Estimating Overall Average Treatment Effect

If we knew $\mu_i$ and $\eta_t$, then we could move terms around in our model
and have:
$$
y_{it} - \mu_i - \eta_t = \tau_{gt} D_{it} + \varepsilon_{it}.
$$
Then, if we ran this regression of an outcome variable ($y_{it} - \mu_i - \eta_t$) on an indicator variable $D_{it}$, then OLS algebra says that $\hat{\tau}$ will take the average of $\tau_{gt}$ for us and estimate the overall average treatment effect $\tau$.

Too bad we don't know $\mu_i$ and $\eta_t$... Since we don't know them, why don't we instead estimate them? From the Frisch-Waugh-Lovell (FWL) theorem, we have:
$$
y_{it} - \hat{\mu}_i - \hat{\eta}_t = \tau_{gt} \tilde{D}_{it} + \varepsilon_{it},
$$
where everything looks about the same, but now $\hat{\mu}_i$ and $\hat{\eta}_t$ are estimated and $\tilde{D}_{it}$ is the treatment indicator after being residualized by unit and time fixed effects. The left-hand side is a good estimate for $\tau_{gt}$, so what's the problem then? This residualized treatment variable is actually the source of *all* the problems you've heard about. No really, go look at the proofs in those papers, you'll see $\tilde{D}_{it}$ right away. 

**The problem is that since $\tilde{D}_{it}$ is no longer a simple dummy variable, OLS no longer estimates the simple average of $\tau_{gt}$.**

Instead, OLS estimates 
$$
\hat{\tau} = \sum w_{gt} \tau_{gt} \neq \tau,
$$
where the weights $w_{gt}$ are quite strange, but sum to 1. I'll leave it to the paper to describe the weights, but no this: In some cases, $\hat{\tau}$ can be the opposite sign of the overall average treatment effect, $\tau$ ðŸš©ðŸš©! 

Okay, so why donâ€™t you just regress $y_{it} - \hat{\mu}_i - \hat{\eta}_t$ on $D_{it}$? Great idea! You just thought of the two-stage difference-in-differences estimator (and Borusyak et. al.'s estimator too)

### Two-stage Difference-in-Differences estimator

The above intution (hopefully) has lead us directly to the two-stage differences estimator as proposed by [Gardner (2021)](). The two stages are as follows:

- Stage 1: Estimate $\mu_i$ and $\eta_t$ using untreated/not-yet-treated observations ($D_{it} = 0$). Don't include $D_{it} = 1$ since the treatment effects will be partially absorbed by unit and time fixed effects.

- Stage 2: Regress $y_{it} - \hat{\mu}_i - \hat{\eta}_t$ on $D_{it}$, not $\tilde{D_{it}}$!.

Inference is a bit more complicated in this two-step estimator since your "outcome variable" is a noisy estimated object. Valid inference needs to account for this first-stage estimation. The details are in the paper and done properly in the `{did2s}` package. 


### `{did2s}`

The paper then goes on to show off the `{did2s}` package and provide some practical advice when implementing the estimator. For example, we will show how `{did2s}` works for a dataset of simulated data with a treatment effect of 2.

```r
library(did2s) 
data("df_hom")

static = did2s(
  df_hom,
  yname = "dep_var", treatment = "treat", cluster_var = "state",
  first_stage = ~ 0 | unit + year,
  second_stage = ~ i(treat, ref=FALSE), 
  verbose = TRUE
)
```
```
Running Two-stage Difference-in-Differences
â€¢ first stage formula `~ 0 | unit + year`
â€¢ second stage formula `~ i(treat, ref = FALSE)`
â€¢ The indicator variable that denotes when treatment is on is `treat`
â€¢ Standard errors will be clustered by `state`
```

Since the package returns a `fixest` object, you can use the suite of exporting tools that `fixest` provides, like `esttable` and `iplot`/`coefplot`. This makes, for example, exporting latex tables and event-study plots super simple.

```r
fixest::etable(static)
```
```
                           static
Dependent Var.:           dep_var
                                 
treat = TRUE    2.025*** (0.0307)
_______________ _________________
S.E. type                  Custom
Observations               31,000
R2                        0.31846
Adj. R2                   0.31846
```

Alternatively, if we use relative year indicator variables in the second-stage, we estimate event-study type coefficients.

```r
dynamic = did2s(df_hom,
    yname = "dep_var", treatment = "treat", cluster_var = "state",
    first_stage = ~ 0 | unit + year,
    second_stage = ~ i(rel_year, ref=c(-1, Inf)),
    verbose = FALSE
  )
```

Then, plutting an event study is super simple with `fixest::coefplot`.

```r
# plot rel_year coefficients and standard errors
fixest::coefplot(dynamic)
```
