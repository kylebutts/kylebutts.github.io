<Hello />

My name is Kyle.

I'm a PhD candidate in Economics at the [University of Colorado: Boulder](https://www.colorado.edu/economics/) focusing in the fields of _Urban Economics_ and _Applied Econometrics_. [My work](/papers/) studies land-use regulation and its' effects on inequality and mobility. My econometric work aims to improve causal-inference methodology in settings where the effects of treatment travel over space.

I also proudly contribute to [open source](/open_source/) projects.
